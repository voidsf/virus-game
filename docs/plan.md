# Virus game – Initial plan

Your virus spreads among coworkers and office employees in a city. There are several methods of infection, through an in-person attack, a malicious email or a system exploit. You collect personal data from employees, and sell it to gain points to upgrade your computer virus. IT teams fight against you, developing countermeasures and conducting virus trainings. As your virus progresses in cases, your view of the world will expand, and you will recieve more points for upgrades, but also more resistance.
You will gain the ability to shut down IT teams temporarily by locking their computers with DDOS attacks.
